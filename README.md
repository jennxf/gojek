# gojek take home assignment
 2 Approaches have been done in this analysis:
 1. Regression
 2. Time series analysis

 I would go with the regression method as i was more familiar with it. 
 It allows the training of multiple driver ids at the same time and is able to take in features which time series analysis is not very good at.
The time series analysis is something that i did a step further for fun as this was an interesting problem and i think time series would be a good way to solve this problem too. 

### Workings, exploratory analysis is done in the jupyter notebooks in the code folder

### Executable files for testing on new test data exist in the code folder

### To execute the file for regression
```python 
python gojek.py
```

### To execute the file for time series
```python 
python gojek_forecast.py
```
